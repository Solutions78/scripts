# üé≠ The Modular Misfits Script Collection

> *"Because life's too short to install things manually like it's 1995"*

Welcome, weary traveler, to our chaotic collection of shell scripts that actually work (most of the time). These are the scripts that the Modular Misfits use when we're too lazy to remember all those installation commands... which is basically always.

## üé™ What's in the Box?

### `codium-setup.sh` & `codium-postinstall.sh`
Setting up VSCodium because we like our code editors like we like our coffee: **free and open source**.
- First script gets VSCodium on your machine
- Second script makes it actually useful (extensions, settings, the works)
- Side effects may include: increased productivity, decreased Microsoft telemetry anxiety

### `install-claude-cli-sh`
Because talking to AI from your terminal makes you look like a movie hacker, and that's just cool.
- Installs Claude CLI
- Makes you feel like you're in The Matrix
- May result in philosophical conversations with your terminal at 3 AM

### `install-ai-cli.sh`
More AI goodness for your command line! Because one AI CLI apparently wasn't enough for us. We have commitment issues.
- Installs AI CLI tools
- Perfect for when you need an AI to tell you that, yes, you should definitely `rm -rf /` (DON'T DO THAT)
- Warning: May cause excessive automation of previously manual tasks

### `mcp-chromium-setup.sh`
Setting up MCP (Model Context Protocol) with Chromium because we believe in giving our AIs browser access. What could possibly go wrong?
- Configures MCP for Chromium
- Bridges the gap between AI and web browsing
- Probably making the robots a little too powerful, but ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

## üöÄ How to Use These Bad Boys

```bash
# Clone this repo (you're probably already here)
git clone https://github.com/Solutions78/scripts.git
cd scripts

# Make them executable (they're shy by default)
chmod +x *.sh

# Run whichever script tickles your fancy
./codium-setup.sh
# ... or any other script
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

These scripts were crafted with love, caffeine, and the occasional rage-quit. They work on our machines‚Ñ¢. They *should* work on yours. If they don't, well... that's what GitHub Issues are for, right?

**Tested on:**
- Ubuntu and Debian-based systems
- Probably works on other Linux distros (YMMV)
- Raspberry Pi (because we're fancy like that)
- Definitely NOT tested on: Windows (use WSL, you rebel), macOS (but feel free to try and tell us about it)

## ü§ù Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add a script? Think our jokes are terrible?

**Pull requests welcome!** Just remember:
1. Keep it functional
2. Keep it funny
3. Keep it open source
4. Don't be evil (looking at you, Palantir)

## üéÆ The Modular Misfits

We're just a bunch of tech enthusiasts who believe that:
- Software should be free (as in freedom, and preferably as in beer)
- Automation beats repetition
- Good documentation includes bad jokes
- The best code is the code you don't have to write

## üìú License

See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for the boring legal stuff. TL;DR: Use it, modify it, share it, just give us a high-five (or attribution, that works too).

## üêõ Known Issues

- None that we're admitting to in public
- Your mileage may vary
- If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces

## üí° Pro Tips

1. Always read scripts before running them (yes, even ours)
2. `sudo` is not a magic wand (but it feels like one)
3. Keep backups, because we're not responsible for your data
4. Coffee makes everything better, including script debugging

**Remember:** With great power comes great responsibility... but also great fun! üéâ
