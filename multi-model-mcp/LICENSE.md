# The "Don't Be a Jerk" License (DBAJ)

## Multi-Model MCP Extension

**Version:** 1.0 (The "We're Serious But Not Really" Edition)
**Copyright:** ¬© 2025 Modular Misfits. All wrongs reserved.

---

## The Short Version (For People Who Don't Read)

Do whatever you want with this extension, just:
1. **Give us credit** (we have fragile egos that need feeding)
2. **Don't be a jerk** (yes, that's legally binding... sort of)
3. **Keep it open source** (sharing is caring, after all)

If you can handle those three simple rules, congratulations! You're licensed! üéâ

**Permission is hereby granted**, free of charge, to any person, robot, AI, sentient toaster, or otherworldly being obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Multi-Model MCP Extension"), to deal in the Extension without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Extension, subject to the following totally reasonable conditions:

### You SHALL:

1. **Attribution, Baby!**
   - Include "Created by the Modular Misfits" somewhere visible
   - A link back to our repo would be cool: https://github.com/Solutions78/scripts

2. **Keep the Spirit Alive**
   - Derivatives must remain open source (no pulling a sneaky on us)
   - Pass on the same freedoms we've given you
   - Continue the tradition of bad jokes in documentation

3. **Share Your Improvements**

### You SHALL NOT:

1. **Be Evil**
   - No using this extension for nefarious purposes
   - No training evil AI overlords (the friendly kind are fine)

2. **Blame Us**
   - If it breaks, that's a you problem
   - We're not liable for data loss, existential crises, or sudden urges to rewrite everything in Rust
   - Seriously, test before deploying to production

3. **Remove Attribution**
   - Don't pretend you wrote this (we have git history, we know things)
   - The Modular Misfits must be credited, it's like the Prime Directive but for code

**Translation:** We made this extension for fun and sharing. It works for us. It should work for you. If it doesn't, we'll try to help, but we're not signing anything legal that says we have to fix your stuff at 3 AM on a Sunday.

## Why This License?

Because we believe in:
- **Freedom:** Like a bird, but with more code
- **Community:** Sharing is how we all get better
- **Fun:** Life's too short for boring licenses
- **Credit:** We put work into this, a little recognition goes a long way
- **Open Source:** It's not just a license, it's a lifestyle

## Can I Use This For Commercial Projects?

**YES!** Make that money! Just:
- Keep the code open source
- Give us credit
- Consider buying us a coffee (or contributing back)
- Don't be a jerk about it

---

## What About Patent Claims?

We don't have any patents. If someone claims we violated theirs, that's between them and us. You're free to use the extension, but you assume any patent risks (which we think are approximately zero, but lawyers made us say this).

## Questions?

- **"Can I...?"** ‚Üí Probably yes, if you're not being a jerk

- **"Will you...?"** ‚Üí Maybe, ask nicely

## Final Words

This license is inspired by the principles of open source, the philosophy of "don't be evil," and the certainty that lawyers make everything too complicated.

**In the immortal words of Bill & Ted:** "Be excellent to each other."

**P.P.S.** If you actually read this entire license, you deserve a cookie. üç™ (Metaphorical cookie, we can't actually send you one... unless you send us your address... which you shouldn't do because internet safety.)
