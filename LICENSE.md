# The "Don't Be a Jerk" License (DBAJ)

## Also Known As: The Modular Misfits Open Source License

**Version:** 1.0 (The "We're Serious But Not Really" Edition)
**Copyright:** ¬© 2025 Modular Misfits. All wrongs reserved.

---

## The Short Version (For People Who Don't Read)

Do whatever you want with this code, just:
1. **Give us credit** (we have fragile egos that need feeding)
2. **Don't be a jerk** (yes, that's legally binding... sort of)
3. **Keep it open source** (sharing is caring, after all)

If you can handle those three simple rules, congratulations! You're licensed! üéâ

## The Slightly Longer Version (For People Who Sort of Read)

**Permission is hereby granted**, free of charge, to any person, robot, AI, sentient toaster, or otherworldly being obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Scripts of Power"), to deal in the Scripts without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Scripts, subject to the following totally reasonable conditions:

### You SHALL:

1. **Attribution, Baby!**
   - Include "Created by the Modular Misfits" somewhere visible
   - A link back to our repo would be cool: https://github.com/Solutions78/scripts
   - If you become famous using our scripts, a shout-out would be nice (we accept pizza as payment too)

2. **Keep the Spirit Alive**
   - Derivatives must remain open source (no pulling a sneaky on us)
   - Pass on the same freedoms we've given you
   - Continue the tradition of bad jokes in documentation

3. **Share Your Improvements**
   - If you make something better, consider sharing it back (karma is real, probably)
   - Bug fixes are especially appreciated (we're only human... mostly)

### You SHALL NOT:

1. **Be Evil**
   - No using these scripts for nefarious purposes
   - No training evil AI overlords (the friendly kind are fine)
   - No creating Skynet (we're looking at you, time travelers from 2029)

2. **Blame Us**
   - If it breaks, that's a you problem
   - We're not liable for data loss, existential crises, or sudden urges to rewrite everything in Rust
   - Seriously, read the scripts before running them

3. **Remove Attribution**
   - Don't pretend you wrote this (we have git history, we know things)
   - The Modular Misfits must be credited, it's like the Prime Directive but for code

## The Legal-ish Mumbo Jumbo

THE SCRIPTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF GOOD TASTE.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MODULAR MISFITS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCRIPTS OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SCRIPTS.

**Translation:** We made these scripts for fun and sharing. They work for us. They should work for you. If they don't, we'll try to help, but we're not signing anything legal that says we have to fix your stuff at 3 AM on a Sunday.

---

## Why This License?

Because we believe in:
- **Freedom:** Like a bird, but with more code
- **Community:** Sharing is how we all get better
- **Fun:** Life's too short for boring licenses
- **Credit:** We put work into this, a little recognition goes a long way
- **Open Source:** It's not just a license, it's a lifestyle

---

## Can I Use This For Commercial Projects?

**YES!** Make that money! Just:
- Keep the code open source
- Give us credit
- Consider buying us a coffee (or contributing back)
- Don't be a jerk about it

---

## What About Patent Claims?

We don't have any patents. If someone claims we violated theirs, that's between them and us. You're free to use the scripts, but you assume any patent risks (which we think are approximately zero, but lawyers made us say this).

---

## Derivative Works

If you fork, modify, or build upon these scripts:
- Your work must also be open source
- You must credit the Modular Misfits as the original authors
- You can add your own name/group as a contributor (sharing credit is cool)
- Keep the spirit of fun and freedom alive

---

## Questions?

- **"Can I...?"** ‚Üí Probably yes, if you're not being a jerk
- **"Should I...?"** ‚Üí When in doubt, do the right thing
- **"Will you...?"** ‚Üí Maybe, ask nicely

---

## Final Words

This license is inspired by the principles of open source, the philosophy of "don't be evil," and the certainty that lawyers make everything too complicated.

**In the immortal words of Bill & Ted:** "Be excellent to each other."

**Signed (with a digital flourish),**

**The Modular Misfits**

*Makers of scripts, breakers of nothing (intentionally), believers in open source*

**P.S.** If you're a lawyer and you're reading this, hello! We tried to make this fun AND legally sound. If we failed at the latter, please send friendly suggestions, not cease-and-desist letters. We're nice people, promise.

**P.P.S.** If you actually read this entire license, you deserve a cookie. üç™ (Metaphorical cookie, we can't actually send you one... unless you send us your address... which you shouldn't do because internet safety.)
